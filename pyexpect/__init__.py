    ## Matchers #########################################################################################
    
    # All public methods on this class are expected to be matchers.
    # Beware the consequences if you break this promise. :)
    
    # On writing matchers:
    # You really only need to throw an AssertionError from the matcher and you're done.
    # However, you should always use the self._assert* family of methods to do so, to support automatic negation.
    
    # On naming matchers:
    # Their name should be clear and fit in with the naming scheme of the existing matchers. 
    # That is: short and active if possible. Matcher names should fullfill two roles. 
    # They should allow direct usage, without chaining in front of them:
    #    expect(3).equals(3)
    # They should also allow chaining to read more like a sentence:
    #    expect(3).to.equal(3)
    #    expect(3).is_.equal(3)
    # If sensible, also support an operator overloaded forms:
    #    expect(3) == 3
    # The goal is to allow the code to read sensible and as similar to the generated error message as possible.
    # Include as many alternative names as make sense.
    
    # Right now some be_* prefixes are included as aliasses, but I will probably phase 
    # them out in favor of using arbitrary chaining to achieve their effect.
    
    # On debugging matchers: Some pyton debuggers will hide all the internals of the expect method
    # To match py.tests behaviour. Read up on hidden frames and how to unhide them in your python debugger
    # `hf_unhide` is often the keyword here.
